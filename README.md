# Midterm-Pong-Project
<p> We visioned our midterm project to be based on the game Pong. It was a journey to figure out how we can
this through arduino and processing. The struggles we've encountered provided the best rewards. 
Obstacles we've encountered obstacle was how he can get the left and right paddles to move up and down with the potentiometer. 
Another obstacle was how how we can get the ball to move and interact with the left and right paddle.
Our final obstacle was how we can get the button to reset the ball and score. After all of that the Pong Game was fully 
functional and playable, with the paddles moving up and down with the potentiometer. The ball could interact with the paddles,
when the ball missed the paddle it would reset back to the center of the window and every time the ball hits the paddle, the 
ball would move faster, just to make the game a bit more challenging. There was a game score added to the function when 
every time the ball missed the paddle, the opposite side would earn a score, plus 1 every time it misses.
